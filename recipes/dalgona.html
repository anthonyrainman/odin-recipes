This Korean-inspired drink is perfect for those who enjoy a unique coffee experience.</div>
        <div class="ingredients">
            <ul>
                <li><b>2 tablespoons</b> instant coffee</li>
                <li><b>2 tablespoons</b> granulated sugar</li>
                <li><b>2 tablespoons</b> boiling water</li>
                <li><b>1 pinch</b> of cinnamon</li>
                <li><b>1 cup</b> milk of choice</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

                <li>Add all the coffee, sugar and boiling water in a bowl (you can easily double or triple this recipe). Using a hand mixer or stand mixer and whip on one of the higher speeds.
                </li>
                <li>Whip the entire mixture for about 2 minutes. Scrape down the sides and whip any bits that didn't get whipped.</li>
                <li>Taste (it'll be very strong! But of course diluted with your milk) and add more sugar IF desired. I've seen some people add another tablespoon of sugar, but it was fine for me. Remember it'll be diluted with the milk!</li>
                <li>Add the coffee to a tall glass (about 8 ounces/1 cup) of your favourite milk. I've tried it with soy milk, almond and oat milk. If you're doing iced, add a few ice cubes, then the milk, then spoon the whipped coffee on top. If using hot, just add it to the glass.</li>
                <li>Using your spoon or straw, stir vigorously to swirl it into your milk.</li>
                <li>Sip and enjoy! </li>
            </ol>
