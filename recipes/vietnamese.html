        <div class="description">Vietnamese Coffee, or Cà Phê, is a rich and robust brew that reflects the coffee culture of Vietnam. Typically made with strong dark-roast coffee, it's brewed using a traditional drip filter called a phin. The coffee is then poured over sweetened condensed milk, creating a deliciously sweet and creamy drink. Often served iced, Vietnamese Coffee is perfect for those who appreciate bold flavors with a touch of indulgence.</div>
